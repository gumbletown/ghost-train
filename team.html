                    Jonnine Standish is an acclaimed and experienced art director, creative director and musician, perhaps best known as one-half of the lauded minimal electronic duo, HTRK. Thematically her lyrics explore the body’s reaction to work and loss using sex drive and humour as themes and devices.<br><br>

                    With over a decade of work as the singer and co-producer of the band HTRK, alongside Nigel Yang, she has produced three critically acclaimed studio albums, toured the world over and collaborated with Chunky Move choreographer Anouk van Dijk, fashion designers Pageant (winners of Tiffany & Co National Design Award 2015), and film directors such as Andrew Dominik, Nathan Corbin and Laure Prouvost (winner of the 2014 Turner Prize). 

                    <br><br>Amongst her multiple collaborations is the work with the iconic Rowland S. Howard, including the single ‘I Know A Girl Called Jonny’and most recently new tracks with UK producer Powell for XL Recordings. Working as a senior art director at Clemenger BBDO for the last two years on the new Myer account, her creative work includes concept generation and development of seasonal campaigns. A past career highlight was working on the Levi’s® brand transformation in the UK and Australia and creating award winning TVCs for Levi’s®. Jonnine also conceptualises and curates unique events, including a full-moon party titled M*Sync, for Melbourne’s MPavilion. In partnership with MPavilion and Unconscious Collective (Motel Dreaming/Dark Mofo), Jonnine presents an engaging portable live multimedia artwork space, animated by the synchronised heartbeats of resting audience members. M*Sync 2 is currently in progress for February 2017.

                          <div class="modal-body">
                            Jasmin Tarasin is a renowned film director, drawn to her craft by her fascination for finding the essence and beauty in between the layers of reality. Her distinctly feminine style exposes the delicacy and honesty of her subjects. With a sense of nostalgic elegance, her work draws on influences from old world European cinema, and is infused with personality and a sense of the fantastical. <br><br>

                            Tarasin’s passion for colour, costume and dance has allowed her to work in the commercial realm, as well as direct documentaries, music videos, art exhibitions and installations. Jasmin’s highly successful video installation work ‘Live’ for Sydney Festival 2010 features artists Jarvis Cocker, Warren Ellis, Feist, Martha and RufusWainwright and Peaches amongst many more. This work stripped back the façade of performance allowing a shared emotional experience between performer and viewer. <br><br>

                            ”Live succeeds on every level to give an unbridled glimpse into the complex and intriguing art of self expression. This is a really fresh idea executed to perfection.” The Vine<br><br>

                            Tarasin has directed over 20 music videos along with memorable television commercials internationally and nationally. Her directorial debut, a four part television documentary series on the artistic process of fashion designers in Australia titled ‘The Closet Tales of Australian Fashion’ garnered her a nomination for best documentary in the 2006 ATOM awards.<br><br>

                            She also directed a one hour documentary for ABC1 entitled ‘Utopia Girls - The history of women’s rights in Australia’. It tells the fascinating story of how Australian women became the first in the world to gain full political rights featuring performances by Barry Otto, David Fields, Alexandra Schepisi, Tom Budge and many more.<br><br>

                            “brilliantly told in this thoughtful film … the use of actors in historical reenactment is most effective in conveying the extraordinary times in which these little known men and woman revolutionized their society “ The Age <br><br>

                            Tarasin’s most anticipated work is her ferocious feature debut titled ‘The Burial’, based on the successful novel concerning the most wanted woman in Australia in 1920, Jessie Hickman, a female bushranger. A true Australian Gothic tale. This is currently in major development.<br>

                            Danielle Brustman has worked extensively as a set designer and maker in a diverse range of fields most notably film, theatre, interior architecture, exhibition design and furniture design. She lives in Melbourne and has designed for numerous theatre, film and design companies including: Arena Theatre Company, The Malthouse, Blackthorn Pictures, The Flying Fruit Fly Circus, Stuck Pigs Squealing, Third Drawer Down and David Bromley Studio. She has art directed music videos for Eskimo Joe, Something for Kate and The Whitlams. Her set design work has received and been nominated for multiple awards.<br><br>

                            Michelle Boyde. I once read an article in a magazine that went something like this:<br><br>

                            ‘Fashion and Art are like two great dames at a cocktail affair that are acutely aware of each other’s existence, but refuse to acknowledge the other is in the room’ <br><br>

                            My interest has always been the conversation these two might have if they got drunk enough.<br><br>

                            Having an early career in the performing arts as a dancer and choreographer, and increasingly interested in exploring a more fashion forward approach to costume, Michelle creatively produced ‘FLASH Fashion’, as part of the L’Oreal Melbourne Fashion Festival’s Arts Program in 2004. FLASH was a collaborative event designed to encourage conversation between the local fashion, and the visual and performing arts industries, resulting in the founding of FAD (Fashion Art Drama).<br><br><a href="http://www.brustmanboyde.com/">www.brustmanboyde.com</a><br><br>

                           Finnish electronic musician and composer Mika Vainio was one half of the minimal electronic duo Pan Sonic from Finland, (the other half was Ilpo Väisänen). Before starting Pan Sonic in beginning of the 90’s, Mika Vainio has played electronics and drums as part of the early Finnish industrial and noise scene.<br><br>

                          His solo works, under his own name and under aliases like Ø, are known for their analogue warmth and electronic harshness. Be it abstract drone works or minimal avant techno, Vainio is always creating unique, physical sounds.<br><br>

                          He released on labels like editions Mego, Touch, Wavetrap and Sähkö and he has been producing with Alan Vega of Suicide, Keiji Haino, Chicks on Speed,

                        HTRK originates from Melbourne (2003 - present).After six years in London, both Standish and Yang returned to Australia in 2012. They have produced three critically acclaimed studio albums along with multiple EP’s. <br><br>HTRK’s vision is mainly about emotion – having just the right amount of expression versus restraint. They could unleash a sonic nightmare – how they temper their power is what makes them unique.<br><br>HTRK’s music is not a quick-fix for restless, impatient minds; it needs to absorbed, contemplated and revisited. Listen to one of their records and you’ll find yourself slipping deep into their sound world, where the cavernous reverberations of dub techno are mixed with frosted post-punk motifs and the gravelly imperfections of industrial, reimagined in the setting of a dingy basement.<br><br>

                           Lawrence English is composer, media artist and Lawrence English is media artist, composer and curator based in Australia. Working across an eclectic array of aesthetic investigations, English’s work prompts questions of field, perception and memory. He utilises a variety of approaches including sound, installation, projection and polymedia objects to create works that meditate on subtle transformations of space and ask audiences to consider that which might sit at the edge of or beyond their perception. His pieces have been presented widely in Europe, the UK and Japan, as well as in the USA, NZ and Australia.<br><br>Outside of his art practise, English composes provocative sound and music of which The Wire notes ‘the use of space and silence is remarkable’ and Signal To Noise calls ‘extraordinarily gorgeous modern music concréte’. He has written extensively for publications orbiting topics of music, art and culture. English also directors the imprint and multi-arts organisation maintaining a steady release schedule from an eclectic array of Australian and international artists and producing a number of sound and music festivals annually including Open Frame (both in Australia and the UK).<br><br>
